## **About Documentation**

Welcome to the Quartile API documentation. You'll find tutorials, tips, and extra documentation on using the Developer Portal, tokens, and more.

Our APIs are currently documented using the OpenAPI standard; if you have questions about API endpoints, you can access the Developer Portal and go to the endpoint you want to learn more about.

## **Check API Connection**

Change the "**{{sub_key}}**" to your subscriber key. 
If you don't have a subscriber key, you can create one in the Developer Portal.
